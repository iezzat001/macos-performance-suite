## 🔑 Authentication Options

### Option 1: GitHub CLI (Recommended - Easiest)
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if not installed
brew install gh

# Authenticate with GitHub
gh auth login

# Push to your repository
cd /Users/iEzzat/Desktop/Organized/Maintenance_Scripts
gh repo create macos-performance-suite --public --source=. --push
```

### Option 2: Personal Access Token
```bash
# 1. Go to GitHub.com → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
# 2. Generate new token with 'repo' permissions
# 3. Copy the token
# 4. Use it as password when prompted

cd /Users/iEzzat/Desktop/Organized/Maintenance_Scripts
git push -u origin main
# Username: iezzat001
# Password: [paste your personal access token]
```

### Option 3: SSH Keys (Most Secure)
```bash
# 1. Generate SSH key (if you don't have one)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your.email@example.com"

# 2. Add SSH key to ssh-agent
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# 3. Copy public key to GitHub
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
# Go to GitHub.com → Settings → SSH Keys → Add new key

# 4. Change remote URL to SSH
cd /Users/iEzzat/Desktop/Organized/Maintenance_Scripts
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:iezzat001/macos-performance-suite.git
git push -u origin main
```
